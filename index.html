        Follow your own learning path because it is the only way to simplify
        your journey to becoming the best programmer you can be. Following a
        path laid out by someone else makes the journey unnecessarily difficult.
        The key(magic) is to take whatever resource you have access to and
        create your own learning path. In other words; master the concepts your
        way in a self-paced manner. As you faithfully do this you will gradually
        realize that your unique thinking patterns, thoughts, and your creative
        spirit will come to bare and lead you to your goal far easier than by
        following someone else's path.

        In line with the first point. Don't depend solely on others doing things
        for you. Try your best to do things for yourself. Do all in your power
        to get things done for yourself. When you allow others to do things for
        you or solve problems for you it's their solution and not yours.
        Consequently it becomes harder for you to internalize that solution and
        make it your own. When you think of or come up with a solution to a
        problem by yourself it makes you depend less on others to get problems
        solved. This way of life helps you

        in this world. As a bonus, when you are comfortable solving your own
        problems yourself you easily pick up tips and tricks from how other
        people go about solving thier own problems. This you can incorporate
        into your personal problem solving "arsenal".

        Understanding a problem is extremely important to being able to solve
        it. It is pertinent to state that trying to solve a problem that has not
        really been understood easily leads to frustration and time wasting.
        Before allocating time and resources with the goal of solving a problem
        or meeting a need, it is wise to first of all ensure that the problem or
        need is well understood. It is better to go after a problem that one has
        a deep understanding of than to go after a problem that one is only
        interested in solving without a deep understanding. It is important to
        restress this point. When it comes to choosing between solving a problem
        that a person is interested in (no matter the extent of ones interest)
        as opposed to a problem that one has a deep understanding of, the wisest
        thing to do is to go after the problem that is properly understood.

        Trying to get into tech the conventional way may make it impossible to
        ever get into tech. Try an unconventinal approach; be creative. Getting
        into tech the unconventional way is even easier (but of course would
        still require alot of hard work).

        Learn to think for yourself. Learn to figure out for yourself how things
        work. You are at the mercy of others when they figure things out for
        you, hire you, or add you to their team. It is them and not you that
        call the shots, make decisions and get the larger share of rewards. They
        will also do away with you the moment you are no longer needed or they
        find someone better than you, often, with no regards for your welfare or
        emotion. Thinking and figuring things out for yourself makes it easy to
        transition from been unemployed to getting a job; starting a career and
        ultimately fulfilling your life's task. Make it your overaching goal in
        life to think for yourself. Thinking plays a crucial role in achieving
        all round freedom in life.

        Sometimes to get an idea you need to focus on what already exists. The
        services and products already available when observed/analysed can help
        you think of ways to improve upon them. Better still it makes it easy to
        come up with something different or new as opposed to getting a new idea
        or way of doing things from no where. N.B: Sometimes it's when you have
        looked for a very long time at code you have written that you begin to
        get ideas to improve it.
